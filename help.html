			The objective of this game is for you, the player, to control Donald Trump and navigate him to the presidency. <br>The first part of the game
			is the Republican primary where Donald needs to collect delegates (in the form of flags). <br>If Donald can get to 1237 delegates, he wins the Republican
			nomination and gets to the next part of the game: The chase for the White House. <br>The chase for the White House will involve Donald
			collecting electoral college votes from the same states. If Donald can get to 270, you win the game!

			<br /> <br />Move Donald with the arrow Keys

			You start with 4 health points. <br>There's a cannon in the middle with an enemy wielding it. The enemy is dependent
			on your current score and progression - Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Hillary Clinton. <br>The cannon will rotate continuously and fire bullets.
			If you(Trump) gets hit by a bullet, you will lose a health point. <br>If you lose all health points then you lose the game.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are additional enemies as well. <br>They will appear as you progress through the game and follow him. If they get to
			Donald, Donald will lose one health point. <br>These enemies are the assassin sent by the Establishment
