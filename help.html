		<b><p style="width:750px;background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF">The Objective</p></b>
		<p style="width:700px">
			The objective of this game is for you, the player, to control Donald Trump and to navigate him to the presidency. The first part of the game
			is the Republican primary where Donald needs to collect delegates (in the form of flags). If Donald can get to 1237 delegates, he wins the Republican
			nomination and advances to the next part of the game: The chase for the White House. The chase for the White House will involve Donald
			collecting electoral college votes from the same states. If Donald can get to 270, you win the game!

		<b><p style="width:750px;background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF">About the Game</p></b>
		<p style="width:700px">
			You start with 4 health points. There's a cannon in the middle with an enemy wielding it. The enemy is dependent
			on your current score and progression - Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Hillary Clinton. The cannon will rotate continuously and fire bullets.
			If Trump gets hit by a bullet, you will lose a health point. If you lose all health points then you lose the game.
